# Project: CAPSTONE Travel App

The goal of this project is to build a travel app that obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays the weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.


This project also uses Node and express for the webserver and routing, and uses webpack as a build tool.
